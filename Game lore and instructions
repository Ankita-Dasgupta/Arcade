Hangman Game Instructions:
The evil monster thinks of a word,
You try to guess what it is one letter at a time.
The monster gives you a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word.
If you suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the game fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places.
If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the other player draws one element of a hangman’s gallows.
As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in the word.
The number of incorrect guesses before the game is six,
but completing a character in a noose provides a minimum of six wrong answers until the game ends.
If the correct answer has been guessed it moves forward to the next game.
